# Tip-Calculator

This is a web app used to calculate the tip to be split between guests when eating out at a resturant.

The user can input the amount of the bill and how good the service was they received on a scale ranging from 0 to 30%.
there is another option for the user to select how many people are splitting the bill and then displays the appropiate amount
to tip based on the information they selected, when the calculate button is pressed.
